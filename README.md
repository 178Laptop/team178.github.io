# The 2nd Law Enforcers Team Website

## Contributing
When making a code related change to the website, be sure to follow the best practices below.

1. Check changes with a local offline copy before committing to master. See [Using Jekyll with Pages - Installing Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll) for how to do this.
2. Make sure existing code organization is followed. Not limited to but including:
  - 2 space indents (not tabs) on both HTML and CSS.
  - Indents are used where they should be to maintain hierarchy in code.
2. If you don't know, ask!

This section of the README file is copied from the [Changing HTML and CSS on the Website wiki page](https://github.com/team178/team178.github.io/wiki/Changing-HTML-and-CSS-on-the-Website).

## Text Editor of Choice

Many of the website team use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as our text editor of choice. If you already have a preferred text editor, you are free to use that! But if you are just starting out, you can try Atom.

You can get the installer for your OS on [Atom's homepage](https://atom.io/). If you're on Ubuntu, you can use this guide:
[Guide for Ubuntu](https://codeforgeek.com/2014/09/install-atom-editor-ubuntu-14-04/) If you're on Windows you need to right click the installer and click "Run as Administrator". If it fails restart your computer and try installing it a couple of times. If that also fails go to Google for help.
