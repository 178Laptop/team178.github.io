The 2nd Law Enforcers Team Website

## Contributing
When making a code related change to the website, be sure to follow the best practices below.

1. Check changes with a local offline copy before committing to master. See [Using Jekyll with Pages - Installing Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll) for how to do this.
2. Make sure existing code organization is followed. Not limited to but including:
  - 2 space indents (not tabs) on both HTML and CSS.
  - Indents are used where they should be to maintain hierarchy in code.
2. If you don't know, ask!
