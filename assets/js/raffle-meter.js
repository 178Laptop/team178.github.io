Hi! If you're reading this then you're probably not me. That means that you also
probably don't understand how this works.I'll try and help you understand.
There're a bunch of comments scattered around that should help you along. I
would suggest that you read through this code carefully; the things that you
have to change manually should be clearly marked, However, if they aren't
everything should be explained below.
THINGS TO ENTER IN YOURSELF:
* The date and time that the raffle ends.
* The number of days after the raffle that you want the meter content to change.
* The link to the Google Sheet that the information is being stored in.
* The column that the status of the tickets is recorded in.
* The characters that are used to symbolize each state of the tickets. (If you
change it for whatever reason, please also change the comment to match.)
*(maybe) The amount "sold" is multiplied by to create the money variable. (It's
explained more at the specific place in the code.)
* The message that automatically shows up when the raffle ends. (I'm still iffy
on what I've written there.)
* The year that it currently is. (I'm sure there's a way to dynamically change
that but I don't feel like coding that right now.)

WHAT THIS CODE DOES:
It pulls information from a Google Spreadsheet and counts the number of 0s ,1s,
and 2s there are in a specified column. The number of 0s is counted as the
number of booklets that haven't been touched; the number of 1s counts as the
booklets that're out being sold; and the 2s count as the number of booklets that
have been sold. These numbers are then turned into statistics that get displayed
on the website as the progress bar. There are two different ways it gets
displayed based on if large-raffle-meter = true in the front matter of the page.

If you're /still/ confused after reading all of this please contact either
[Tim Scalzo](19scalzoti@fpsct.org) or [Giselle Koo](gisellegk@gmail.com) for
help. (Yes, I realize that this isn't actually markdown; I just wanted to do
that.)

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
