## *FIRST* Robotics Competition
<img class="float-left" alt="FRC Logo" style="width:275px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/FIRST-logos/FRC-logo.png"/> *FIRST* Robotics Competition is for kids from grades 9-12. While each team has students as its members, they also have coaches and mentors who help as needed. A motto created by our team that encapsulates this idea is "Mentor nurtured, student driven." The members of the team do a majority of the work, the mentors are only there to provide guidance when it's needed. Each year the students are challenged to create a robot that can compete in a game. The robot that they create is made almost entirely from scratch; the students do everything from the designing to the programming. This competition provides high school-age kids with professional level experiences in a fun and hands-on way.
