## *FIRST* Robotics Competition
<img class="float-left" alt="FRC Logo" style="width:275px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/FIRST-logos/FRC-logo.png"/> *FIRST* Robotics Competition is for kids from grades 9-12. While each team has students as its members, they also have coaches and mentors who help as needed. A motto created by our team that encapsulates this idea is "Mentor nurtured, student driven." The members of the team do a majority of the work, the mentors are only there to provide guidance when it's needed. Each year the students are challenged to create a robot that can compete in a game. The robot that they create is made almost entirely from scratch; the students do everything from the designing to the programming. This competition provides high school-age kids with professional level experiences in a fun and hands-on way. Read about some fast facts below!

#What is *FIRST* Robotics Competition? 
The *FIRST* program all started with the *FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC), which is designed to inspire high school students to become engineers by giving them real world experience working with professional engineers to develop a robot. The inaugural *FIRST* Robotics Competition was held in 1992 in the Manchester Memorial High School gymnasium. As of 2009, over 3,000 high school teams, totaling over 37,000 students from Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United States, the United Kingdom are all part of the *FIRST* Robotics Competition. The competition challenge changes each year, and the teams can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh around 120 lb, depending on each year's rules. The kit issued to each team contains a base set of parts. Registration and the kit of parts together cost about $5000 USD. In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game are released on the first Saturday in January, and the teams are given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks. In 2008, teams participated in 41 regional competitions throughout March in an effort to qualify for the *FIRST* Championship in Atlanta, Georgia in April. 

Here are some quick facts: 
In 2019, over 51,000 robots were created. Previous years' championships have been held in Houston, Texas, Detroit, Michigan and at Walt Disney World's Epcot. Each year the *FIRST* Robotics Competition has scholarships for the participants in the program. In 2019 there was $80 million worth of scholarships from colleges, universities, associations, and corporations. Also, over 575,000 students have participated in *FIRST* and 92% of those students have been more interested in attending college. Eighty-nine percent of alumni declare a major in STEM and 99% of *FIRST* students improve in team work and being being able to solve unexpected problems. Female alumni are 5.3 times major in computer science.
