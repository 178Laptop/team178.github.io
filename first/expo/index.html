On January 27th, teams will be given the opportunity to display their achievements and ideas. They will also participate in various STEAM and theme-based activities. The 2nd Law Enforcers are organizing and running the event. We also have created and will run the activities for the teams to participate in. In addition to activities for FLL Jr. teams, there is also a scrimmage for FLL teams to take part in that is expanding this year.
