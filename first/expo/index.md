We run & host the Farmington Valley _FIRST_ Expo (FVFE). Students plan every aspect of this event, from creating city-themed STEAM activities to coordinating logistics. Over the last 8 years, this unique event has grown to encompass every level of _FIRST_, including an FLL Jr. Expo, FLL scrimmage, & FTC/FRC robot demonstrations. There were 34 FLL Jr, 14 FLL, 1 FTC, & 5 FRC teams at this event to share their accomplishments & be inspired through experiential learning. The FVFE is a unique showcase of _FIRST_ due to its focus on our youngest participants, guiding them to see what is possible at all levels of _FIRST_. On a Sunday during build season, we reached over 1000 people in this celebration of _FIRST_.
