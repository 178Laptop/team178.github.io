## How to Join
We accept new members from September to mid-November or from May to the end of school.

# There are two ways that you can join the team:
1. Talk to a coach
  * Mr. Barron - Talk to him in person in the science office or send him an email at [BarronT@fpsct.org](mailto:barront@fpsct.org)
  * Mrs. Hall - Talk to her in person in the math office or send her an email at [HallM@fpsct.org](mailto:hallm@fpsct.org)
2. Email [ContactUs@FarmingtonRobotics.org](contactus@farmingtonrobotics.org)

# After doing one of the above, please fill out the following forms.
**Note:** You must print the two forms out, fill them out *legibly*, scan them into your computer, turn them into a single .pdf file ([help](#pdf-help)), upload that file to Google Drive, and share it with [Trips@FarmingtonRobotics.org](trips@farmingtonrobotics.org).

You can either use your home printer/scanner to turn your forms into .pdfs or you can use a mobile app. There is one for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free&hl=en){:target="_blank"} and one for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876?mt=8){:target="_blank"} (iPhones & iPods).
