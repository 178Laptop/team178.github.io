### How to Join
We accept new members from September to mid-November or from May to the end of school.

# There are two ways that you can join the team:
1. Talk to a coach
  * Mr. Barron - Talk to him in person in the science office or send him an email at [BarronT@fpsct.org](barront@fpsct.org)
  * Mrs. Hall - Talk to her in person in the math office or send her an email at [HallM@fpsct.org](hallm@fpsct.org)
2. Email [ContactUs@FarmingtonRobotics.org](contactus@farmingtonrobotics.org)

# **After doing one of the above, please fill out the following forms.**
**Note:** You must print the two forms out, fill them out *legibly*, scan them into your computer, turn them into a single .pdf file ([help with this](#pdf-help)), upload that file to Google Drive, and share it with [Trips@FarmingtonRobotics.org](trips@farmingtonrobotics.org).
