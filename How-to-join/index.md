Now that you’re interested in becoming a new member, you must talk to your guidance counsellor and ask them how to join Robotics!

We are not taking any more members for now. But in the fall, we will be having a new member’s meeting (date to be announced! watch the 9:05 news). You can talk to any high school student with an Enforcer shirt on to learn about the team. 

New members must join before the last session of safety training (usually by the end of November). The school also requires 2 permission slips to be completed: The Field Trip form and the Consent form. You can submit them by scanning them and sharing them on Google Drive at trips@farmingtonrobotics.org or handing them to Mr. Barron or Mrs. Hall.
