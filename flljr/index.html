On January 28th, 2018, teams will be given the opportunity to display their achievements and ideas. They also will participate in various STEAM and theme-based activities. The 2nd Law Enforcers organize and run the event. We also create and run the activities for the teams to participate in. In addition to activities for FLL Jr. teams, there are also activities for FLL teams to take part in that are expanding this year. If you are part of a team that is participating in the <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr/challenge-and-season">Aqua Adventure Challenge</a>, you can now register for the 2018 expo!
